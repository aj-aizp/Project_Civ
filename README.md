### Project Civ 

Source code for my Real Time Strategy game built in the Unity engine. 
The C# scripts are found here: Project_Civ/Assets/Scripts. 
All the art and animations were done by hand using Aseprite. 

I would also like to credit Joseph Hocking on his "Unity in Action Third Edition" book on the coding basics of Unity.
